# OOP examples in JavaScript

JavaScript has objects, but doesn't have classes. Most probably you won't need classes and inheritance in JavaScript but, anyway, it is possible to simulate them using the [prototype chain](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Inheritance_and_the_prototype_chain).

In this repository you will find different examples to simulate classes and inheritance. Use [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) to run them.

Run `node` [`test_classes.js`](test_classes.js) to execute the JavaScript example. You can edit it and choose between 3 ways of declaring classes ([`classes_v1.js`](classes/classes_v1.js), [`classes_v2.js`](classes/classes_v2.js) and [`classes_v3.js`](classes/classes_v3.js)).

There's also an equivalent [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/) example [`oop.rb`](oop.rb) in case you want to compare. This example is much more simple since Ruby syntax is quite short and it's a full-fledged OOP language.
