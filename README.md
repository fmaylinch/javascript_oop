# OOP examples in JavaScript

JavaScript has objects, but doesn't have classes. Anyway, it is possible to simulate classes and inheritance using the [prototype chain](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Inheritance_and_the_prototype_chain).

In this repository you will find different examples to simulate classes and inheritance. Use [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) to run them.

Run `node` [`oop.js`](oop.js) to execute the JavaScript example. You can edit it and choose between 5 ways of declaring classes: [`classes_v1.js`](classes/classes_v1.js), [`classes_v2.js`](classes/classes_v2.js), [`classes_v3.js`](classes/classes_v3.js), [`classes_v4.js`](classes/classes_v4.js), [`classes_v5.js`](classes/classes_v5.js).

There's also an equivalent [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/) example [`oop.rb`](oop.rb) in case you want to compare. Ruby example is much more simple since Ruby syntax is quite short and it's a full-fledged OOP language.
